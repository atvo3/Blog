I used to be into trophy hunting when it was first introduced during the Playstation 3 lifespan.  It was a way to show off meaningless gaming achievements to your friends.  
A platinum marked 100% completion of challenges that existed when the game first came out.  Currently I have 104 platinum trophies but for this post, I will only be reflecting 
on the first 100.  

There were some platinums that I went for because I liked the game enough to go for those achievements.

But then there were some obviously *bad* games with that I went for just to boost the number of platinums I got. xD

Here are some random highlights (and lowlights) when looking back at the trophies I earned along the way to 100 platinum trophies.

<b><u>First Platinum Trophy</u></b>


Dynasty Warriors 6 Empires.  Earned on October 19, 2009.  I was a <i>big</i> Dynasty Warriors fan back in the day.  Those games inspired me to read the classic Chinese literature "Romance
of the Three Kingdoms" which is the novel that the games base their story from.  Dynasty Warriors 4 would be my favorite for nostalgia but I believe 7 was in my opinion their best attempt 
at retelling the Romance of the Three Kingdoms story.

<b><u>Favorite Trophy?</u></b>

<i>"Et Tu, Brute"</i>

A bronze trophy for knifing 5 friends online playing Battlefield Bad Company 2.  It was understood between my friends that we were not going to give our dog tags for free.  It had be earned.
And earn it I did.


<b><u>Terrible games I only played for the platinum</u></b>

- LA Cops
- Goosebumps: The Game
- Jack N' Jill DX
- InkSplosion
- Hitman GO
- Metagal
- Coffin Dodgers
- My Name is Mayo
- Black and White Bushido

<b><u>Favorite Platinum</u></b>

<i>Monster Hunter World Iceborne</i>

The best monster hunter game that I spent over 1000 hours on and loved every hour of it.  It's also a platinum that I have over my friends who also spent over 1000 hours on and I still get to flex on that 
fact as of today :)
