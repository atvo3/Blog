Welp.  It's been a while since I've posted anything on here.  Nothing surprising to me.  Even though I made this blog
to stay consistent with doing personal development projects, I ended up mostly focusing on exercise, sleep, and occasionally
playing my new bass guitar. 

I somehow got hooked into Final Fantasy XIV with some friends.  It's a perfect game if you're into RPG grinds that you can squeeze
in between hours when you're working from home ;)

I've yet to start on any real personal dev projects.  I got ideas but haven't found the right motivation to start due to other passions.

The life of someone with too many hobbies. Maybe I'll post more random stuff on here.  We'll see..
