If you're reading this, then that must mean I was able to get my blog site up and running which is a great
first milestone!

For this website, I wanted to get to get something up and running quick without dealing with the hassle of using 
databases and web APIs so I opted to use Pelican's static site generator.  Having a small background in Python
helps when going through the documentation.  Eventually, I was able to create my own theme by modifying all the
templates that generates all the content for the website.

To simplify making my website more responsiveness and more mobile friendly, I went for Twitter's Bootstrap 
CSS framework mostly because I've had some experience with using it in the past. I also used bootstrap icons for all
of my social media links.

The small sprite logo is the first thing I drew in Aseprite.  I'll probably replace it with something better when I develop
better pixel art skills...

Lastly, I used GitHub to not only manage the source code but to also host the website through GitHub pages.  I learned how to 
set up a Git submodule in the repo that holds the source code to point to the repo that holds all the generated content.

That's pretty much all of the tools currently used to build this website.  Now to start another coding project...
