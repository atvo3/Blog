I finally got inspired to do indoor bike riding with Zwift after watching some fitness youtubers.  
Elliptical had been my primary choice of cardio that I've been able to do at least 150 minutes a week for at least half a year now.
However I can't always go to the gym so having this indoor bike setup helps me stay even more consistent with cardio.

The heart benefits from cardio are very important for a longer, healthier life.  Don't neglect it!

Anyways the basic things you need to get into Zwift are

- a bike (obviously)
- indoor bike trainer (I got Saris Cycle Ops Fluid 2)
- speed/cadence sensor (I went for a Garmin one)

Some optional things that I would also have are 

- Zwift companion app (basically a remote control you can use while riding to send messages, emotes, use powerups, etc)
- Leveling block for bike trainer (for the front wheel, could use a random book instead)
- a shirt on your handle bars (prevents damage from sweat)
- Fans

So far I've tried some small routes in Watopia and Makuri Islands and did one race.  The competitiveness definately helps me 
train harder.

It's best to look up some Zwift videos and see if it's something for you but my first impressions so far is very positive. 

I'll provide updates on my Zwift progress whenever I feel like it.  I've been loving it so far.  Hopefully this bike journey 
lasts long.
